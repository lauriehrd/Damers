Pr√©sentation Anglais

I'll introduce to you my application game. It's a newesr version of damers game.

The damers game as we know is very classic with brown and wood texture.

I used to play damers younger and the first impression that I had was that it's seems difficult to play ith and reserved to adults. But when I started to play I immediately like it.
So is it one of the reason why I wanted to choose damers as my project, to be able to revisited this classic game in a young spirit and large accessibility. For that I choose a cartoon design with a lot of colors and flat design.

Then, the other reason was that in my previous professional training we were asked to code a damers game in javascript, a language that I didin't learn before so I haven't be able to make it. When I started this professional training I challenge myself for being able to realized the game at the end.

In my app you'll be able to save your game and resume when you want, and you'll also have the possibility to choose an avatar as profil picture.

I'll now introduce in French the one page I made to introduce my app.
